# PUBG-Timer

This is a tool for the recently into Early-Access released game ["PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS"](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/).

As players of the game we have noticed that we tend to lose track of the game mechanic of the shrinking circles that restrict the play area.

Watching different streams of other people playing this it seems like we're not the only ones with this "problem".

This is why i decided to write a little program that allows the player to keep an eye on the timers aswell as add an alarm that will notify you whenever you want.

No more losing track and running behind, dying outside the play area.

### Usage:

This tool is pretty straight forward.

- In the middle you see the timings for the circles each in full seconds. White on the left, Blue on the right.
- Decide when you want to be notified and write it into the corresponding entry fields (Also full seconds)
- Hit "Apply Timers" and wait for a game to start. When you're in the "pre-lobby-island" get ready when the Time to Start reaches zero.
- As soon as you see the plane flying and moving (not freezing in the air) hit the Start button.
- The first timer is the prestart timer. When it finishes, the first white circle should appear.
- The other timers will count down one after another - If you have set up a notification time, you will hear an alarm sound when the timer reaches it.

##### Info

- If you're using two or more monitors you can put the tool on your second screen, then ingame open the map/inventory and then move your mouse over and press the button without actually tabbing out of the game.
- You can overwrite an existing already fired alarm by simply putting in a new number and hitting apply again. You can also add additional timers while the program is already running.
- You can change the "alarm.wav" file to whatever you'd like as long as it stays a .wav file and is named "alarm.wav".

### Known Issues

Right now it is a little bit problematic since you have to hit the Start button manually - We're working on a "Global Hotkey" solution that'll allow you to simply start the timers from inside the game.

#### ToDo:
- Add a Global Hotkey to avoid pressing start manually(!)
- Add a "Reset" feature
- Wait for feedback
